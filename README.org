* Introduction

This repository will help to mantain my notes about courses and other
interesting things. The default format for the documents is [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].

To export a file to PDF, inside emacs, call =C-c C-e= which is bound to the
function org-export-dispatch. Inside each file, there is a setup code block to
stablish the mode in how to compile the document. By example, each document
should have something like the following:

#+begin_src org
   #+name: export-setup
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent :var this-year="2022"
     (setq-local org-latex-pdf-process
           (let
               ((cmd (concat "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode"
                             " --synctex=1"
                             " -output-directory %o %f")))
             (list cmd
                   "cd %o; if test -r %b.idx; then makeindex %b.idx; fi"
                   "cd %o; bibtex %b"
                   cmd
                   cmd
                   "mv *.svg %o/"
                   "mv *.png %o/"
                   "rm -rf %o/svg-inkscape"
                   "mv svg-inkscape %o/"
                   "rm -rf *.{aux,bbl,blg,fls,out,log,toc}"
                   (concat "cp %o/%b.pdf ../docs/" this-year "/%b.pdf"))))
     (setq-local org-latex-subtitle-format "\\\\\\medskip
                            \\noindent %s")
     (setq-local org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
   #+end_src
#+end_src
